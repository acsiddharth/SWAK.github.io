              <h3>Listen to music</h3>
            <p>If you're feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try taking a break and listening to relaxing music. Playing calm music has a positive effect on the brain and body, can lower blood pressure, and reduce cortisol, a hormone linked to stress.</p>
              <h3>Talk yourself through it</h3>
              <p>just tell yourself why you're stressed out, what you have to do to complete the task at hand, and most importantly, that everything will be okay.</p>
              <h3>Eat right</h3>
              <p>Stress levels and a proper diet are closely related. When we’re overwhelmed, we often forget to eat well and resort to using sugary, fatty snack foods as a pick-me-up. Try to avoid sugary snacks and plan ahead. Fruits and vegetables are always good.</p>
              <h3>Laugh it off</h3>
              <p>Laughter releases endorphins that improve mood and decrease levels of the stress-causing hormones cortisol and adrenaline. Laughing tricks your nervous system into making you happy. </p>
              <h3>Drink tea</h3>
              <p>try green tea. It has less than half the caffeine of coffee and contains healthy antioxidants, as well as theanine, an amino acid that has a calming effect on the nervous system.</p>
              <h3>Be mindful</h3>
              <p>The concept of “mindfulness” is a large part of meditative and somatic approaches to mental health, and has become popular in modern psychotherapy</p>
              <h3>Exercise (even for a minute)</h3>
              <p>Exercise doesn't necessarily mean power lifting at the gym or training for a marathon. A short walk around the office or simply standing up to stretch during a break at work can offer immediate relief in a stressful situation. Getting your blood moving releases endorphins and can improve your mood almost instantaneously.</p>
              <h3>Sleep better</h3>
              <p>Everyone knows stress can cause you to lose sleep. Unfortunately, lack of sleep is also a key cause of stress.dim the lights, and give yourself time to relax before going to bed. It may be the most effective stress buster on our list.</p>
