this all started when, there was a new admission in class 8th.
a boy who was very rude and annoying and a girl who was very self centered. small fight started which changed into big one but it all landed in very sweet end of friendship.
Both of them were there own ego, but they came close when there was a inter house event "Science Exhibition". this was the time when they started understanding each other better.
they started talking to each other, they started spending more time together...
And yes VO DONO JEET GAYE, they won first prize in that.
Now this event was over everything was back to normal there relation changes a bit
