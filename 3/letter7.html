							<h2>“Open when... it's your Birthday.”</h2>
						</header>
            <p>I guess this should go without saying, but HAPPY BIRTHDAY! It's
						 the day when I was given the great gift of... Well, you!</p>
						<p> It's your day and you deserve to enjoy it. This is going to sound
						 super cheesy, but I'm really glad you were born. You've become
						 such a big and important my life. I hope you know that there are so many
						 people who love you, including myself. I hope you know that
						 you're not in anybody else's shadow, but in your own spotlight.</p>
						<p> It's important to me that you know that. ANYWAYS, I hope you're
						 having a genuinely pleasant day, and not just pretending to be
						happy or anything. You deserve to feel good, at least today,
					 if not every other day of the year. You're one of the biggest,
					 greatest blessings I've had the honour of receiving in my life.</p>
						<p> I'm so thankful to God for you, and I honestly don't know what
						 I would do without you, and I hope I never have to find out.
						 Though, remember that whether we're together or apart, I'll
						always be thinking of you. :)</p>
						<p> Have a great day, and make this next year of your life even greater than the last!
				 You have so much to live for, and I hope with every passing year of your
				  life, you will come to realize that more and more.</p>
					<p>Have a blast!</p>
					<p> With Much Love,</p>
            <p>Me</p>
